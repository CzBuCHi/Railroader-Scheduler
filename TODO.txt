Create basic commands for scheduler to execute:

Move (yard/road as speed) (forward/backward) and stop (before/after) node (aka switch)
Connect air
Release handbrakes
Set handbrake on nth car
Uncouple nth car
Set switch in (front/back) of train [trina needs to be stopped, max 10m from switch]
Restore switch to its original position (store when `Set switch` called)


Record schedule
1) start recording
2) add schedule commands manually (wait for train to stop before adding more)
3) Save schedule with unque name (save in mod settings)

Execute schedule
1) pick locomotive
2) pick schedule by name
3) hit 'execute'

ScheduleRunner will execute commands in sequence
- move command end detection: use observer on persistence.PlannerStatus to detect correct message
